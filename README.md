### What is Jocelyn's Repository?
This is a student respository created for an English 105 data literacy project at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

It helps students, faculty, researchers, or anyone with economic curiosities explore trends in Scandanavian economies. Tons of economic data are published by think tanks and various federal agencies, but it's often challenging to navigate through them and narrow down neccesary information. This repository focuses specifically on Scandanavian economic growth with GDP per capita data for various countries. 

### What Data is Available?
This repository contains one python notebook with a manipulated data set and markdown instructions, a .csv file with GDP per capita data across several nations, and a .csv file with the final manipulated data of GDP per capita and perent change in Scandanavian nations. See *Data* folder to access the files.
