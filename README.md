# Scandanavian Economies


## What is Jocelyn's Repository?
This is a student respository created for an English 105 data literacy project at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

It helps depict trends in **Scandanavian economies**. Tons of economic data are published by think tanks and various federal agencies, but it's often challenging to navigate through them and narrow down neccesary information. This repository focuses specifically on **Scandanavian economic growth** with **GDP per capita data** for various countries. 



## What Data is Available?
This repository contains **one python notebook** with a manipulated data set and markdown instructions, a **.csv file** with GDP per capita data across several nations, and a **.csv file** with the final manipulated data of GDP per capita and perent change in Scandanavian nations. See **Data** folder to access the files.


## How can this Data be Used?
This repository was created since many people, both economists and students, praise the economic growth and overall wellbeing of Scandanavian nations. It can be used to contribute to research about the state of Scandanavian economies and which nation's economic policies to adopt in the US.


## Who is this Repository For?
The project is designed to serve researchers, students, policymakers, economists, professors, or **_anyone_** with economic curiosities that might lack the understanding, time, or expertise to process loads of economic data themselves.

I want to make this data **_navigable, accessible, and reproducible_** for as many people as possible. If you face any challenges related to these objectives, please contact me at **jocew@unc.edu**. 


## Data Visualizations
The graphs depict changes in Scandanavian real GDP per capita over time. The *Bar Chart Race* shows active changes through a 2000-2019 timeline.

The Percent *Change Bar Graph* illustrates the percent change in rGDP per capita over that time. This helps viewers understand the nature of economic growth in Scandanavia, along with comparing them to each other and other nations.
