# Data
This folder contains the raw and manipulated data sets (.csv files), along with a Jupyter notebook with instructions and code to detail the data manipulation process.


- **PROVENANCE**: this data came from a {compilation of GitHub data sets} (https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) that Prof. Gotzler recommended to his class. 
- **PURPOSE**: this code is for anyone wishing to explore economic data in Scandanavian nations (and the US). It reflects changes in GDP per capita across severeal countries. 
- **POTENTIAL**: this repository was created since many people, both economists and students, praise the economic growth and overall wellbeing of Scandanavian nations. It can contribute to research about the state of Scandanavian economies and which nation's economic policies to adopt in the US.
