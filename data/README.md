# Data
This folder contains the **_raw and manipulated data sets_** ( in .csv file format), along with a **Jupyter notebook** containing the instructions and code detailing the data manipulation process.


#### About the Data
- **Provenance**: this data came from a [compilation of GitHub data sets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) that Prof. Gotzler recommended to his class. 
- **Purpose**: this code is for anyone wishing to explore economic data in Scandanavian nations (and the US). It reflects changes in GDP per capita across severeal countries. 
- **Potential**: this repository was created since many people, both economists and students, praise the economic growth and overall wellbeing of Scandanavian nations. It can contribute to research about the state of Scandanavian economies and which nation's economic policies to adopt in the US. 

More information can be found in the main page's README file.
